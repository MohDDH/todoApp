**âœ… To-Do List Web App**

A dynamic and user-friendly to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app helps users stay organized by allowing them to add, edit, delete, filter, and reorder tasksâ€”all while saving progress in the browser using Local Storage.

**ðŸŒŸ Features**

- Add new tasks via button click or pressing Enter  
- Filter tasks: All, Active, or Completed  
- Update task status with checkboxes  
- Edit task text inline using a prompt  
- Delete tasks with one click  
- Auto-save tasks in Local Storage  
- Display the number of tasks left  
- Reorder tasks using drag-and-drop

**ðŸ“¦ Structure**

Folder contents:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`
- `images/` folder containing:
  - `icon-check.svg`
  - `icon-cross.svg`
  - `icon-moon.svg`
  - `icon-sun.svg`

**ðŸš§ How It Works**

All tasks are stored in localStorage using a simple array of objects like:
```
{
  id: Number,
  text: String,
  isComplete: Boolean
}
```
Tasks are dynamically inserted into the page (DOM), with event listeners added for various interactions. Filtering displays the relevant tasks while preserving the full list. Drag-and-drop reorders items and updates the data source.

**ðŸ“‹ Getting Started**

1. Clone or download the project  
2. Open the `index.html` file in any browser  
3. Start adding tasks â€” theyâ€™ll be saved automatically

No installation or build tools required.

- Add sound effects or notifications for task changes
